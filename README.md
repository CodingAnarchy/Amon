# Amon v0.0.2

An interface for secure email written in Python.

Currently in development - being used to familiarize myself with Keybase for future project work.

* Can view contact list (adding or removing contacts in progress)
* Email is encrypted
* Interfaces with Keybase.io and GnuPG
  
# In Development

* Reply/Forward emails
